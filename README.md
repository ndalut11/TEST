Smart Waste Management System using IoT
 
Introduction
 
The Smart Waste Management System using IoT is a cutting-edge solution to improve waste management operations by leveraging the power of the Internet of Things (IoT) technology. By deploying IoT devices such as sensors and cameras, the system can monitor waste levels and track waste collection trucks in real time. This information is transmitted to a central database where it is analysed to optimise waste collection routes, reduce emissions from waste trucks, and improve the overall efficiency of waste management. The system also provides real-time information on waste levels, allowing city officials to make informed decisions about waste management and identify areas for improvement. Implementing this intelligent waste management system will bring numerous benefits, including reducing the environmental impact of waste collection, improving public health and safety, and increasing the efficiency and sustainability of waste management operations.
 
 
Objectives:
 
1. To develop an intelligent waste management system that utilises IoT technologies to improve waste collection and disposal processes.
2. To improve the efficiency of waste collection and disposal processes, reducing the environmental impact of waste and increasing the recovery of valuable resources.
3. To provide real-time data and monitoring of waste collection and disposal processes, enabling cities and communities to make informed decisions about waste management.
4. To reduce the costs associated with waste collection and disposal, including transportation, processing, and disposal fees.
5. To increase public awareness and participation in sustainable waste management practices.



Section 2: Literature Review (describe the key papers and website you have found to support your project using Harvard citations with bibliographic details in the reference section) material you are using but cite the references use references) 


Section 3: Methodology (the steps you are going to carry out and an indication of the kind of methodology this approach belongs to – quite often different parts will fit with different methodologies). Address the deliverables and evaluation (What will you produce and how will you test, compare and provide critical analysis of your work?) 


Section 4: Technical Aspects and Risk Factors (what software / hardware might you need (and how you expect to get this.ight go wrong or not happen to threaten your project, and how might you mitigate
